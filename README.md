# Agentic â€” Static Landing (Vite + React + Tailwind)

A minimal static landing page scaffold built with Vite (static site builder on Node.js), React, and Tailwind CSS.

## Quick start

1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed.
2. Create the project folder and copy files from this document.
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Build static assets:

```bash
npm run build
```

6. Preview the built site:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploy
Deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3 + CloudFront, GitHub Pages).

## Customization notes
- Replace text and graphics with your brand assets.
- Swap Tailwind colors in `tailwind.config.cjs` to match your brand.
- Add real logos and SVGs in `src/components/` if you split components.

## Why Vite?
Vite is an open-source, Node.js-first dev server and build tool. It provides extremely fast HMR for local development and produces a static `dist/` folder ready for static hosting.
